# Iris_Flower_Prediction
This project aims to distinguish between different species of iris flowers using the Iris dataset. The dataset contains different samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample is categorized into one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify the iris species based on these features, providing a practical introduction to classification tasks in data science.
